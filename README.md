A command-line JSON and YAML validator that's on your wavelength.

## Getting Started

```

```

## Usage Examples

```bash
# v8r queries https://www.schemastore.org/ to detect a suitable schema based on the filename
$ v8r package.json  # v8r can validate JSON..
Validating package.json against schema from https://json.schemastore.org/package ...

Errors:
[

    keyword: 'type',
    dataPath: '.name',
    schemaPath: '#/properties/name/type',
    params: { type: 'string' },
    message: 'should be string'
  }
]

‚ùå package.json is invalid

$ v8r action.yml  # ..and YAML
Validating action.yml against schema from https://json.schemastore.org/github-action ...

# if v8r can't auto-detect a schema for your file..
$ v8r chart.yaml

## FAQ

### ‚ùì How does `v8r` decide what schema to validate against if I don't supply one?

üí° `v8r` queries the [Schema Store catalog](https://www.schemastore.org/) to try and find a suitable schema based on the name of the input file.

### ‚ùì My file is valid, but it doesn't validate against one of the suggested schemas.

üí° `v8r` is a fairly thin layer of glue between [Schema Store](https://www.schemastore.org/) (where the schemas come from) and [ajv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv) (the validation engine). It is likely that this kind of problem is either an issue with the schema or validation engine.

* Ajv issue tracker: https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues

### ‚ùì What JSON schema versions are supported?

üí° `v8r` works with JSON schema draft-04, draft-06 and draft-07.

### ‚ùì Will 100% of the schemas on schemastore.org work with this tool?

üí° No. There are some with [known issues](TODO:issue-link)

### ‚ùì Can `v8r` validate against a local schema?

üí° Nope. There are other better tools for this. If you want to validate against a local schema, I recommend [ajv-cli](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-cli/).
